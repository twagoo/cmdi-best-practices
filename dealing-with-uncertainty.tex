\textbf{In many cases one has to model for uncertainty. For example, the
creation date of a document may not be known or only by approximation.
Rather than making a field for such information optional, it might be
desirable to provide the metadata creator with an option to make this
uncertainty explicit. A ``string'' typed field provides this option
(i.e.~it allows the metadata creator to enter ``?'' or ``unknown'') but
does so at the cost of value ``safety'' - in this example it does not
enforce a standardised date format. A better approach is to require a
value of a more specific type if applicable, for example a date or
integer. Alternatively avocabularyorpatterncan be used to constrain the
values that may be entered, optionally including a literal value like
`Unknown'. You can add an (optional) attribute with type ``boolean'' or
a vocabulary to allow the metadata creator to specify the level of
uncertainty.}

\textbf{Note that in many cases making an element optional is a valid
modelling decision for cases where information might not be available.}
