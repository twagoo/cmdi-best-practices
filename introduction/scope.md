What does the Best Practices cover?

The target audience for the Best Practice guide includes 1\) CMD modellers, who select or create components and profiles to describe certain language resources, 2\) developers who create metadata converters, forms or editors to create records that comply with these profiles, and 3\) a, hopefully small, group of CMD creators who create records by hand. In contrast researchers, while being the ultimate end-users of the CLARIN infrastructure, do not belong to the primary target audience of this guide. Researchers are, in general, not directly exposed to CMDI, but if so should be fully guided by an application \(with its own user guide\) and shielded from the technical details. Furthermore, using this Best Practice guide will require a basic understanding of CMDI - it is not intended as a tutorial. The CLARIN infrastructure can deal with any valid CMD record that is based on a profile from its Component Registry. The technical specification \[CMDI Task Force 2016\] acts as a baseline with its declarative definitions and examples of valid CMD profiles, components and records. In contrast, the CMDI Best Practice guide is process oriented and aims to guide the work involved in constructing valid and high quality CMD profiles, components and records. The scope of the best practices goes beyond those purely schematic constraints and ranges from modelling guidelines, e.g. prefer elements over attributes, to rather low-level technical guidelines, e.g. use the UTF-8 encoding for your CMD records. As a consequence, the CLARIN infrastructure may extract information more efficiently from CMD records that meet these best practices and, hence, provide the end users improved access to those records, the context from which they originate and the resources they provide.
