\subsection{Workflow}\label{authoring-workflow}

The workflow for creation of CMDI records for hosted resources will depend on the specific conditions and requirements at your centre. CMDI files can be created (semi-)manually (by editing XML files or using tools such as CMDI Maker\footnote{See http://cmdi-maker.uni-koeln.de/, but notice that CMDI Maker only supports 2 profiles!}, COMEDI,\footnote{See http://clarino.uib.no/comedi/} and Arbil\footnote{See
https://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/arbil/, but notice that Arbil is not maintained anymore!} - this will usually be done by the resource owners), or by automatic conversion from existing metadata formats with the usual benefits and disadvantages of manual and automatic data creation respectively.

Concerning metadata quality assessment in the workflow, some aspects can be checked before CMDI is imported into the VLO:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  all CMDI metadata must validate against the profile XSD
\item
  manually created CMDI should go through automatic consistency checks
\item
  all CMDI metadata should be checked for features that cannot be   covered by the profile XSD - the
  \href{https://github.com/clarin-eric/cmdi-instance-validator/releases/latest}{CMDI Validator} includes a set of Schematron rules that can be used for   additional specific Schematron checks (and adapted as necessary)
\item
  the \href{https://clarin.oeaw.ac.at/curate/}{CLARIN Curation Module}   should be used to assess records
\end{itemize}

The following aspects on the other hand need to be checked after VLO import:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  appropriateness of all normalized and mapped values for VLO facets (cf.~VLO-mapping) - any mapping issues should be reported via \href{mailto:cmdi@clarin.eu}{\nolinkurl{cmdi@clarin.eu}}
  \note{Alex: Shouldn't VLO mapping above be a link?}
\item
  appropriateness of the display of resource hierarchies, especially in cases where MdSelfLink and/or ResourceProxy values are changed as part of the workflow.
\end{itemize}
