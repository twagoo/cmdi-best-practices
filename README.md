# CMDI Best Practices

2016 saw the release of both version 1.2 of the [Component Metadata](https://www.gitbook.com/book/clarin-eric/cmdi-best-practices/edit#) \(CMD\) Infrastructure \(CMDI\) \[CLARIN ERIC 2017\] and a first complete technical specification \[CMDI Task Force 2016\]. This new version provided new possibilities, which have been gradually opened up by the ecosystem of tools and registries in CMDI. One of the key properties of CMDI is its flexibility, which makes it possible to create metadata records closely tailored to the requirements of resources and tools/services. However, design and implementation choices made at various levels in the CMD lifecycle might influence how well or easily a CMD record is processed and its associated resources made available in the CLARIN infrastructure. Knowledge on this has traditionally been scattered around in various documents, web pages and even completely hidden from sight in experts’ minds. To make this knowledge explicit, the CMDI and Metadata Curation Task Forces have teamed up to create this Best Practice guide. This guide, together with the technical CMDI 1.2 specification, will be a valuable knowledge base and will help any \(technical\) CMDI user to bring her CMD records to their full potential use within [CLARIN](https://www.clarin.eu).

## General TODOs

* [ ] Add icons or colours to indicate BP priority, maybe add an appendix with BP ordered by priority

* [ ] Also indications if a BP corresponds to a B Centre requirement, and also if/how its technically “validated” \(by the CMDI Validator or the Curation Module\)

* [ ] Add section numbers
